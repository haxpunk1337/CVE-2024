## Vulnerability Description
A SQL Injection vulnerability was discovered in Memu Play version 9.0.9. The vulnerability allows an attacker to perform unauthorized database queries by manipulating the `type` parameter in the `/new_market/service.php` endpoint.

## Proof of Concept
The vulnerability can be reproduced by sending a malicious request to the affected endpoint. Below is an example of the raw request:

```
POST /new_market/service.php HTTP/1.1
Host: stat.microvirt.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0
Content-Length: 321
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
X-Forwarded-Host: stat.microvirt.com
X-Forwarded-Proto: https
X-Forwarded-Url: https://stat.microvirt.com/new_market/service.php
Accept-Encoding: gzip

```

By manipulating the `type` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.

## Impact
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.

## Recommendation
It is recommended to update Memu Play to the latest version to mitigate this vulnerability. Users should also ensure that their systems are protected by up-to-date antivirus software and follow secure coding practices to avoid potential injection attacks.
